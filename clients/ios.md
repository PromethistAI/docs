Initially, only public applications are available. If you are registered in the Promethist platform, you can **Log in** using the button in the upper left corner of the screen. After that, you will be able to use applications which were assigned to you.

#### Talking to the bot

The interaction with the bot is voice-only. The bot starts listening when the rectangle turns green. If the rectangle is blue, the bot is processing the input. The current response can be skipped by tapping the area with Promethist logo. Tap the **Restart** button to start the conversation from the beginning.

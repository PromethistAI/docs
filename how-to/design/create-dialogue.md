  The basic low-level element of conversation design on the Promethist platform
  is a "dialogue model". Let's take a look how to create it.

# Create It

The dialogue model represents the dialogue flow in the form of a graphical structure of interconnected nodes. 

### Create dialogue model

1. **Go to** _**Design &gt;&gt;**_ [_**Dialogue Designer**_](https://docs.promethist.ai/app/working-space/design/dialogue-designer) or just use the [keyboard shortcut](https://docs.promethist.ai/app/keyboard-shortcuts) **d** to open the Dialogue Designer.
2. **Click on** _**Model &gt;&gt; New**_**â€¦** or just use the keyboard shortcut **n** to create a new dialogue.
3. In the first box, choose the **Space** you want to save your dialogue in.
4. In the second box, pick a name for your dialogue model \(preferably in the form _name-space/dialogue-name_\).
5. **Click on** _**Create**_.

And that's it, you just created your first dialogue model.
